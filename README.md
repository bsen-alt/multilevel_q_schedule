Multilevel Queue Scheduling Simulation program

Multilevel Queue CPU Scheduling Simulation program is designed to emulate and visualize the process of scheduling tasks within a computer system using the multilevel queue scheduling algorithm. Traditional operating systems employ scheduling mechanisms to efficiently allocate the CPU's processing time among competing processes. The multilevel queue scheduling algorithm categorizes processes into different priority queues, ensuring that higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones.
